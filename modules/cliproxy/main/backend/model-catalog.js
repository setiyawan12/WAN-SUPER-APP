 * CLIProxyAPI's /v1/models doesn't namespace ids by login provider -- it
 * returns the raw underlying model id (e.g. "claude-opus-4-1-20250805",
 * "gemini-3.1-flash-image"), not "claude/claude-opus-4-1-20250805". So for
 * ids we don't already know about, we can't read the provider off a path
 * segment.
 *
 * If exactly one OAuth provider actually has stored credentials, there's no
 * ambiguity -- every live id necessarily came from that one account, since
 * CLIProxyAPI only ever returns models for accounts that are logged in.
 * (This matters because Antigravity alone serves Gemini- *and* Claude- *and*
 * GPT-named ids through a single Google OAuth login -- guessing "claude" in
 * the name means "Claude Code login" would wrongly invent a separate
 * "Claude"/"Codex" provider group with no credential behind it.)
 *
 * Only when 0 or 2+ providers are logged in (genuinely ambiguous) do we fall
 * back to guessing from the model name, same buckets as the Providers page.
 *
 * CLIProxyAPI itself gives us no better signal here: its /v1/models response
 * is a flat, unattributed list (confirmed against its source -- the registry
 * keeps one entry per model id with no per-OAuth-account tag, and the
 * `owned_by` field it does expose reflects the underlying model vendor, e.g.
 * "anthropic", not which logged-in account is actually serving it). So once
 * 2+ providers are logged in, there's no live API call that can tell us
 * "this claude-named id is really coming through Antigravity" -- the only
 * place that fact can live is in something *we* remember from before it
 * became ambiguous. See resolveProvider() below for how that's used.

 * models the current accounts may not actually have access to and confuses
 * "what's toggleable" with "what CLIProxyAPI can actually serve right now".
 *
 * `loggedInProviders` is the list of provider ids that actually have at
 * least one stored auth file (from GET /auth-files) -- passed in so unknown
 * ids get bucketed by real stored credentials instead of just guessed names.
 *
 * `openAiCompatEntries` is the raw list from GET /openai-compatibility --
 * ids that match one of these are bucketed under that entry's own name
 * *before* guessProvider/loggedInProviders ever run, so a custom provider
 * never gets misattributed to whichever single OAuth provider is logged in
 * (see buildCustomProviderIndex).
 *
 * `memory` is the persisted id -> provider map learned during past
 * unambiguous (single-provider) calls (see resolveProvider doc above).
 * Returns the updated memory alongside the model list -- the caller
 * (routes.js) is responsible for persisting it via state.js so the learned
 * attribution survives across requests and server restarts.
 *
 * `prefixIndex` maps a credential's `prefix` (see routes.js's
 * /auth-files/prefix, management-client.js's setAuthFilePrefix) to its real
 * provider. A live id like "claude/claude-sonnet-4-6" -- CLIProxyAPI's own
 * namespacing for a prefixed credential, giving it a routable id no other
 * credential shares -- resolves straight to that credential's actual
 * provider here, with total certainty (no guessing needed): this is exactly
 * the mechanism that lets two credentials serving the identical bare model
 * id (e.g. Antigravity and Claude Code both offering "claude-sonnet-4-6")
 * be told apart and toggled independently in the Models page.
